### Step 2: Price Prediction Models (Daily Prices)
10 distinct models trained and evaluated:

| ARIMA | 0.000079 | 0.006595 | 0.001157 | 55.58% |
| Linear Regression | 0.000079 | 0.006656 | -0.003413 | 54.36% |
| Random Forest | 0.000085 | 0.006912 | -0.081240 | 53.55% |
| XGBoost | 0.000089 | 0.007017 | -0.125899 | 52.74% |

#### Log Return Models:
| Model | MSE | MAE | R² | Dir. Accuracy |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| ARIMA | 0.000079 | 0.006597 | 0.001185 | 55.17% |
| Linear Regression | 0.000079 | 0.006653 | -0.003335 | 54.77% |
| Random Forest | 0.000084 | 0.006866 | -0.068333 | 54.36% |
| XGBoost | 0.000087 | 0.006986 | -0.107948 | 53.35% |

**Key Findings**: 
- ARIMA emerged as best performer for both return types
- Percentage returns marginally outperformed log returns
- Directional accuracy plateau around 55%, indicating market efficiency challenges

### Step 4: Cross-Market Validation
Tested NIFTY 50 models on external US stocks to assess generalization:

#### AAPL Testing:
| Model | MSE | MAE | R² | Dir. Accuracy |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| XGBoost | 0.000327 | 0.012896 | -0.005354 | **53.12%** |
| Linear Regression | 0.003039 | 0.051725 | -8.350330 | 52.64% |
| LightGBM | 0.000355 | 0.013669 | -0.093091 | 47.36% |

#### GOOGL Testing:
| Model | MSE | MAE | R² | Dir. Accuracy |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.003218 | 0.052784 | -7.403429 | **54.01%** |
| XGBoost | 0.000383 | 0.014156 | -0.000673 | 54.01% |
| LightGBM | 0.000412 | 0.015008 | -0.075398 | 45.91% |

**Outcome**: Models showed ~53-54% accuracy, confirming market-independent behavior patterns

## Next Steps & Timeline

### Immediate (Weeks 1-2):
1. Design feature engineering pipeline
2. Build multi-timeframe model architecture
3. Establish baseline ensemble performance

### Short-term (Weeks 3-6):
1. Hyperparameter optimization across models
2. Backtest on 2-year holdout set
3. Validate directional accuracy targets

### Medium-term (Weeks 7-10):
1. Integrate predictions with portfolio strategies
2. Run end-to-end backtesting with transaction costs
3. Compare against buy-and-hold benchmarks

### Deployment Phase:
1. Live prediction pipeline on new data
2. Real-time portfolio rebalancing system
3. Performance monitoring dashboard



### Suggested baselines - 
1. simple day to day linear regression but predicting on for 30 days
2. lstm with decomposition predicting and trained for 30 days
3. garch + classifier(up or down) for 30 days
4. multi head transformer with decomposition for 30 days
5. cnn + lstm with decomposition trained for 30 days
6. separate bi - lstm chains for each component of decomposition, then combining them to get reslut for 30 day prediction
